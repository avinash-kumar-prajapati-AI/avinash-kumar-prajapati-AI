# Hi, I'm Avinash Kumar Prajapati  

I build AI systems that solve real-world problems using **Deep Learning and Agentic AI**, including **fine-tuning models** to generate structured outputs such as SQL queries, command sequences, and MCQ formats.
My focus is on turning research-grade ideas into practical, scalable products—where data, code, and impact meet.
